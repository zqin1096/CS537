A system image is a serialized copy of the entire state of a computer system
stored in some non-volatile form such as a file. 

The file system must have a plan for where it stores inodes and content blocks
on the disk. To do so, xv6 divides the disk into several sections. 

Superblock: contains the metadata about the file system (the file system size
in blocks, the number of data blocks, the number of inodes, and the number of
blocks in the log).

All of the on-disk inodes are packed into a contiguous area of disk called the
inode blocks. Every inode is the same size, so it is easy, given a number n,
to find the nth inode on the disk. In fact, this number n, called the inode
number or i-number, is how inodes are identified in the implementation.

The on-disk inode is defined by a struct dinode. THe type field distinguishes
between files, directories, and special files (devices). A type of zero
indicates that an on-disk inode is free. The nlink field counts the number of
directory entires that refer to this inode. The size field records the number
of bytes of content in the file. The addrs array records the block number of
disk blocks holding the file's content.
